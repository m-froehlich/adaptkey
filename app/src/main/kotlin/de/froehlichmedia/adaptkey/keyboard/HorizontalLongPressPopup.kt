/**
 * Pure layout + selection geometry for the D-44 horizontal long-press popup.
 *
 * The alternatives are shown as a single row of cells directly above the pressed key. The row is centred
 * over the key's stem so the pre-selected cell (the key's own character) sits right above the finger; the
 * finger then slides left/right **below** the row and the cell above the pointer's x is selected. This
 * replaces the D-23 vertical column: it maps a pointer x-coordinate to the selected index and computes the
 * (clamped) row origin, leaving the drawing and touch plumbing to the view.
 *
 * D-144: cells are no longer assumed equal-width - [cellWidths] gives each cell its own width (the view
 * sizes each to its own text content, e.g. a URL protocol popup's `https://`/`ftp://` entries need far more
 * room than a single glyph), so every position here is computed from the actual per-cell widths rather than
 * a uniform `index * cellWidth`.
